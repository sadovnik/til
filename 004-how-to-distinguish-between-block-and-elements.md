## How to distinguish between blocks and elements in BEM

When working with BEM or similar component-based CSS methodology  it's up to you to decide whether an entity is a block or en element. Here are some principles that will help you to make such decision:

* If you want to reuse an entity somewhere in a project without its parent — it's a block.
* If entity doesn't make any sense without its parent (is impossible without its parent) — it's an element.
